## Installing and starting the project

### Update! Configuring Vite. To simplify the changes made, some scripts have been removed and the already-used scripts have been changed to run Vite. This was done so developers already using this won't have to adapt to new scripts. Running "npm run build" will run vite-build and "npm run watch" will run Vite preview. "npm run dev" and "npm run start" both start Vite. - Hans M. Andreassen, Aug22FT

- Installation: `npm i`

- Local server: `npm run dev` or `npm run start`

- Production build: `npm run build` (creates the dist folder and compiles)

- Production build preview: `npm run build-preview` (launches a local server that shows the project as it will show when deployed)
